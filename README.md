# Fusionfall-Recreation
Fan made recreation of the MMO Fusionfall

To run the game extract the .rar folder Fusionfall and Project10
and run the .exe files

For better experience run full screen (But to quit you need to press Alt+Enter to make it run windowed and then you can click on the cross mark to close the game)

It isn't an interactive game its just an exploration level. Not much to do just there to show my level design while trying to recreate the elements of this game.
